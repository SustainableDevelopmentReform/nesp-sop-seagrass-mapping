## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides comprehensive guidelines for mapping seagrass habitats using optical remote sensing techniques. It outlines standardized methodologies for data acquisition, processing, classification, validation, and quality control to ensure consistency, repeatability, and comparability across different mapping initiatives. While the primary focus is on using Sentinel-2 multitemporal imagery within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, the SOP provides flexibility to accommodate alternative satellite sensors, computing environments, and specific project requirements.

### 1.2 Background

Seagrasses constitute one of the most important benthic habitats in coastal waters globally, providing numerous ecosystem services including nursery habitat, carbon sequestration, sediment stabilization, and water quality improvement. Accurate and up-to-date information on seagrass distribution, extent, and condition is essential for effective marine spatial planning, conservation management, and environmental monitoring.

Despite their ecological significance, many seagrass meadows remain unmapped or poorly documented, particularly in remote areas and subtidal environments. Spatial mapping data for seagrass is often lacking in many temperate coastal areas, especially for subtidal habitats in southern regions. Traditional field-based mapping approaches, while accurate, are resource-intensive and impractical for large-scale and repeated assessments.

Remote sensing technologies offer an effective solution for mapping seagrass at various spatial and temporal scales. Optical remote sensing, in particular, leverages the distinctive spectral signatures of seagrass to detect and delineate meadows from surrounding substrate types. Recent advancements in satellite sensor capabilities, cloud computing infrastructure, and machine learning algorithms have significantly enhanced our ability to map seagrass habitats efficiently and accurately.

### 1.3 Overview of Remote Sensing Approaches

Several optical remote sensing approaches can be employed for seagrass mapping, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

**Satellite-based multispectral imagery**: Platforms such as Sentinel-2, Landsat, and commercial satellites (e.g., Planet, WorldView) provide wide spatial coverage and regular revisit intervals, enabling large-scale and temporal monitoring. This SOP primarily focuses on Sentinel-2 imagery due to its optimal combination of spatial resolution (10m), spectral capabilities, global coverage, and free accessibility.

**Airborne multispectral/hyperspectral imagery**: These platforms offer higher spatial resolution but typically cover smaller areas and are acquired less frequently. They may be appropriate for detailed mapping of specific sites or as validation data.

**Drone-based imagery**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors can capture very high-resolution imagery of seagrass beds, but their application is limited to small spatial extents and is often influenced by environmental conditions.

The selection of an appropriate remote sensing approach depends on various factors, including the spatial scale of interest, required mapping accuracy, available resources, and specific project objectives.

## 2. SOP Development

### 2.1 Evolution of Seagrass Mapping Techniques

Remote sensing techniques for seagrass mapping have evolved considerably over the past decades, with significant methodological improvements driven by advances in sensor technology, computational capabilities, and analytical methods.

Early approaches relied primarily on visual interpretation of aerial photographs or simple classification of single-date satellite imagery. These methods, while valuable for establishing baseline distributions, were limited in their ability to distinguish seagrass from other aquatic vegetation and to account for temporal variability in seagrass coverage.

The development of more sophisticated multispectral sensors with improved spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolutions has enabled more accurate discrimination between seagrass and other benthos. Concurrently, the transition from pixel-based to object-based image analysis and the integration of contextual information has enhanced classification accuracy.

The emergence of machine learning algorithms, particularly random forests and boosted regression trees, has further improved mapping capabilities by better capturing complex relationships between environmental predictors and seagrass distribution. Most recently, the adoption of cloud-based computing platforms like Google Earth Engine has facilitated the processing of large volumes of satellite data, enabling multi-temporal analysis and near-real-time monitoring over vast geographic areas.

### 2.2 Current Best Practices

Based on extensive research and practical experience, several best practices have been identified for effective seagrass mapping using optical remote sensing:

- **Multi-temporal image analysis**: Using image stacks acquired over time rather than single-date imagery to minimize the influence of environmental factors (e.g., water clarity, sun glint) and capture seasonal variations in seagrass coverage.

- **Integration of environmental variables**: Incorporating relevant environmental parameters (e.g., bathymetry, wave exposure, substrate type) to improve classification accuracy and ecological relevance.

- **Hierarchical classification approaches**: Employing a staged classification process that first distinguishes broad habitat categories before refining to specific seagrass classes.

- **Robust validation procedures**: Implementing comprehensive accuracy assessment using independent field data and appropriate statistical metrics.

- **Contextual post-processing**: Applying knowledge-based rules and spatial filtering to refine classification outputs and eliminate implausible results.

This SOP incorporates these best practices while maintaining flexibility to accommodate specific project requirements and technological advancements.

### 2.3 Conceptual framework

Figure 1. shows the conceptual framework for technical and methodological components covered in this SOP.

### 2.4 Relationship to Other Protocols and real-world applications

This SOP builds upon and complements existing protocols for marine habitat mapping and seagrass monitoring. It aligns with internationally recognized standards and classification schemes, such as the Seamap Australia Benthic Classification Scheme, to ensure interoperability and consistency across different mapping initiatives.

While primarily focused on remote sensing methodologies, this SOP acknowledges the importance of field-based approaches and encourages their integration as complementary data sources. Reference is made to relevant field protocols where appropriate, particularly for the collection of training and validation data.  

This SOP is accompanied by a real-world application (Seagrass mapping in Tayaritja, Tasmania - Appendix X), and over time, other exmaples will be added.  

## 3. System Architecture

## 7. Classification and Modelling

### 7.1 Machine Learning Algorithm Selection

#### 7.1.1 Random Forest (Recommended Approach)

Random Forest is recommended as the primary classification algorithm for seagrass mapping due to its robustness, interpretability, and proven performance:

**Key advantages**:
- Handles non-linear relationships and complex interactions
- Relatively insensitive to parameter selection
- Provides feature importance metrics
- Resistant to overfitting
- Computationally efficient

**Implementation in GEE**:
```javascript
// Random Forest classifier in GEE
var classifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest({
  numberOfTrees: 500,
  minLeafPopulation: 2,
  variablesPerSplit: null,  // defaults to square root of number of variables
  bagFraction: 0.5,
  seed: 42
}).train({
  features: trainingData,
  classProperty: 'class',
  inputProperties: bands
});
```

**Important parameters**:
- Number of trees (typically 300-500)
- Minimum leaf population (1-5 for seagrass mapping)
- Variables per split (default option typically sufficient)
- Bag fraction (0.5-0.7 recommended)

#### 7.1.2 Alternative Algorithms

**Boosted Regression Trees**:
- Potentially higher accuracy than Random Forest
- More sensitive to parameter tuning
- Often requires more computational resources

**Support Vector Machine**:
- Effective for high-dimensional data
- Requires careful parameter optimization
- May struggle with large datasets

**Deep Learning approaches**:
- Potentially superior for complex patterns
- Requires substantial training data
- Computationally intensive
- Less interpretable than tree-based methods

#### 7.1.3 Ensemble Approaches

Consider ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms for improved performance:

**Majority voting**:
- Combine predictions from multiple classifiers
- Each classifier gets equal weight in the final decision

**Weighted ensemble**:
- Weight individual classifiers based on their performance
- Emphasize more reliable algorithms for specific classes

**Stacked generalization**:
- Train a meta-learner on the outputs of base classifiers
- Can capture complex relationships between classifier outputs

### 7.2 Model Training and Parameterization

#### 7.2.1 Training Data Preparation

Prepare field data for model training:

**Data formatting**:
```javascript
// GEE example for importing and formatting training data
var trainingPoints = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/myproject/assets/seagrass_training_points');

// Add spectral information to points
var sampledPoints = covariateStack.sampleRegions({
  collection: trainingPoints,
  properties: ['class'],
  scale: 10,
  geometries: true
});
```

**Class balancing**:
- Assess class distribution in training data
- Consider stratified sampling or class weighting for imbalanced datasets
- For presence-only data, generate pseudo-absences based on environmental criteria

**Train-test splitting**:
```javascript
// Split data into training and validation sets (70/30)
var withRandom = sampledPoints.randomColumn();
var trainingSet = withRandom.filter(ee.Filter.lt('random', 0.7));
var validationSet = withRandom.filter(ee.Filter.gte('random', 0.7));
```

#### 7.2.2 Feature Selection

Identify the most informative variables for model training:

**Correlation analysis**:
- Calculate correlation matrix between predictor variables
- Remove highly correlated variables to reduce redundancy

**Feature importance assessment**:
```javascript
// Train a preliminary Random Forest to assess variable importance
var classifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(100).train({
  features: trainingSet,
  classProperty: 'class',
  inputProperties: allVariables
});

// Get variable importance
var importance = classifier.explain().get('importance');
print('Variable importance:', importance);
```

**Recursive feature elimination**:
- Iteratively remove least important variables
- Assess model performance with reduced feature sets
- Select optimal feature subset based on validation metrics

#### 7.2.3 Parameter Optimization

Fine-tune model parameters to maximize performance:

**Grid search**:
- Define parameter ranges for testing (e.g., number of trees, minimum leaf population)
- Systematically evaluate combinations using cross-validation
- Select parameter set with highest validation accuracy

**Iterative refinement**:
- Start with default parameters and make incremental adjustments
- Focus on most sensitive parameters identified in literature
- Document parameter sensitivity for future applications

**Cross-validation**:
- Implement k-fold cross-validation for robust performance assessment
- Consider spatial cross-validation for environmental data

### 7.3 Classification Approaches

#### 7.3.1 Binary Classification

Simplest approach focusing on seagrass presence/absence:

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Binary classification in GEE
var binaryClassifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(500).train({
  features: trainingData,
  classProperty: 'seagrass_presence',  // 0 = absent, 1 = present
  inputProperties: selectedVariables
});

// Apply classifier to generate probability map
var probabilityMap = covariateStack.classify(binaryClassifier, 'probability');
```

**Threshold selection**:
- Default threshold typically set at 0.5 (50% probability)
- Consider optimizing threshold based on validation metrics
- Implement ROC curve analysis to identify optimal threshold

**Output format**:
- Probability map (continuous values 0-1)
- Binary presence/absence map after threshold application

#### 7.3.2 Multi-class Classification

More detailed classification incorporating cover classes or species:

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Multi-class classification in GEE
var multiClassifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(500).train({
  features: trainingData,
  classProperty: 'seagrass_class',  // e.g., 0=none, 1=sparse, 2=medium, 3=dense
  inputProperties: selectedVariables
});

// Apply classifier
var classMap = covariateStack.classify(multiClassifier);
```

**Hierarchical approach**:
- First classify seagrass presence/absence
- For present areas, further classify into density or species classes
- May improve accuracy for minority classes

**Class definition considerations**:
- Balance ecological relevance with classification feasibility
- Consider minimum mapping unit constraints
- Align with established classification schemes (e.g., Seamap Australia)

#### 7.3.3 Regression Approach

Estimate continuous cover values rather than discrete classes:

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Regression in GEE
var regressionModel = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(500)
  .setOutputMode('REGRESSION')
  .train({
    features: trainingData,
    classProperty: 'percent_cover',  // Continuous values (0-100%)
    inputProperties: selectedVariables
  });

// Apply model
var coverMap = covariateStack.classify(regressionModel);
```

**Advantages**:
- Preserves continuous nature of seagrass cover
- Avoids arbitrary class boundaries
- May capture subtle gradients better than classification

**Challenges**:
- Requires quantitative training data (percent cover estimates)
- Often higher uncertainty in extreme values
- Validation metrics differ from classification approaches

## 8. Output Production and Validation

### 8.1 Map Generation Process

#### 8.1.1 Classification Implementation

Apply the trained model to generate seagrass maps:

**Basic classification**:
```javascript
// Apply classifier to image stack
var classifiedMap = covariateStack.classify(trainedClassifier);
```

**Probability output**:
```javascript

var probabilityMap = covariateStack.classify(trainedClassifier, 'probability');
```

**Multiple output types**:
- Binary presence/absence
- Cover classes (e.g., sparse, medium, dense)
- Continuous percent cover estimates
- Species distributions (if applicable)

#### 8.1.2 Threshold Application

Convert probability outputs to categorical maps:

**Default threshold**:
```javascript
// Apply 50% threshold for binary classification
var binaryMap = probabilityMap.gt(0.5);
```

**Optimized threshold**:
```javascript
// Apply threshold optimized from validation (e.g., 0.7)
var binaryMap = probabilityMap.gt(0.7);
```

**Multiple thresholds**:
```javascript
// Generate maps at different confidence levels
var highConfidence = probabilityMap.gt(0.8);
var mediumConfidence = probabilityMap.gt(0.6).and(probabilityMap.lt(0.8));
var lowConfidence = probabilityMap.gt(0.4).and(probabilityMap.lt(0.6));
```

#### 8.1.3 Output Formats and Resolution

Prepare maps in appropriate formats for distribution and use:

**GeoTIFF export**:
```javascript
// Export classification as GeoTIFF
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: classifiedMap,
  description: 'Seagrass_Classification',
  folder: 'Seagrass_Mapping',
  region: studyArea,
  scale: 10,
  crs: 'EPSG:4326',
  maxPixels: 1e13
});
```

**Vector format**:
```javascript
// Convert raster to vector for certain applications
var seagrassVector = binaryMap.reduceToVectors({
  scale: 10,
  geometryType: 'polygon',
  eightConnected: true,
  maxPixels: 1e13,
